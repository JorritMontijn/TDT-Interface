# TDT-Interface
Matlab-TDT Data tank interface

This Matlab - TDT data tank inferface requires TDT's proprietary OpenEx libraries and is specifically designed for use with the electrophysiology setup at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience. However, other setups should be able to use it with minor changes as well.

Programmed by Jorrit Montijn, based on Chris van der Togt's prior functions
